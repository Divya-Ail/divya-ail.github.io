<h6><b>Developing Animal models to study disease mechanisms and test therapies</b></h6>

<p align="justify" style="font-size:0.75em">
<b>Non-Human Primates (NHP)</b> <br>
Non-human primates (NHPs) are used as models in biomedical research because of their close genetic, physiological, and neurological similarities to humans. This makes them especially valuable for studying complex biological processes, such as brain function, immune responses, and infectious diseases, that cannot be accurately replicated in more distant species like rodents. <br>
There are many rodent models (mice and rats) of retinal degeneration (RD) that serve well to study retinal diseases and develop some therapies. However, there are several anatomical differences between the rodent and human retina such as the size of the eye, the size and shape of the lens, the relative amount of vitreous and most importantly the presence of a central cone-rich region called macula and a cone-only region called fovea. The macula and fovea are responsible for high-acuity vision and these regions are absent in the rodents which affect how disease features appear and progress in these models, thereby making rodents unsuitable for testing translational therapies.

The non-human primate (NHP) retina is closest to humans and best suited for testing therapies before clinical trials. However, there is a lack of relevant NHP degeneration models that can be used for testing therapies. We addressed this unmet need by using different bioengineering strategies to develop three distinct inducible NHP models of RD – <br>

<b>Optogenetic model:</b> In this model an optogene (a gene that can be activated by light) is packaged in AAVs and delivered to the NHP retina by subretinal injections. The optogene is specifically expressed in the rod photoreceptors due to the presence of a rod cell-specific promoter in the transgene design. The optogene can be activated by using light of a specific wavelength (green light of 565nm). The transparency of the eye allowing light to reach the retinal tissue enables optogene activation by exposing the eye to a light source of 565nm. Upon light activation the optogene becomes toxic and results in photoreceptor-cell death, resulting in cell loss and eventually retinal degeneration.

<b>Crispr-Cas9 model:</b> This strategy involves the use of the Crispr-Cas9 system to disrupt the Rhodopsin gene. A Crispr guide is designed against the Rhodopsin gene, packaged into AAV vectors and delivered to the NHP retina by subretinal injections. Rhodopsin is a light-sensitive receptor protein found in the rod photoreceptor cells of the retina and plays a key role in visual phototransduction, the process by which light signal is detected and converted into electrical signal. Mutation in the Rhodopsin gene results in absence of this protein, inability to carry out phototransduction, loss of photoreceptor cells and eventual retinal degeneration. Mutation in the Rhodopsin gene is the most frequent mutation occurring in patients with the disease Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), and hence this model mimics the RP disease features and progression.

<p align="justify" style="font-size:0.75em">
<b>Physical model:</b> This strategy involves using a polymer patch to create a physical separation between the photoreceptors and Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE). A polymer patch created with the same materials used in retinal prosthesis/ implants was surgically placed in the subretinal space of the macular region (close to the fovea but without including it). The photoreceptors depend on the RPE for their general maintenance and function. So, when this connection is disrupted, photoreceptors start dying eventually causing retinal degeneration.

The models we have created can be used for testing a wide range of these therapeutic strategies. Degeneration of the retina occurs in stages and the chosen vision restoration method largely depends on the type and stage of the disease. In the earlier stages, when the retinal cells are still present neuroprotective factors can be provided to slow down the progression of the disease and gene replacement or editing can be used to compensate for the effect of gene mutations. On the other hand, in later stages when the retinal cells are mostly lost, mutation-independent vision restoration therapies such as stem cell therapy, optogenetic therapy and retinal prosthesis/ implants could help in restoring some useful vision. Additionally, specific therapies can control symptoms that arise from perturbed cellular mechanisms such as oxidative stress, inflammation or neovascularization.

<b>Evaluation of immune responses to therapy:</b> Injection of viruses, transgenes and other therapeutic agents can trigger an immune response which can reduce the efficacy of the treatment or result in inflammation compromising the safety of the treatment. We used the NHP models that I generated and other NHPs that received ocular gene therapies to study such immune responses.
