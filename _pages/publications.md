##### **Editorial Work**
<p align="justify" style="font-size:0.75em">
I was invited to serve as a guest editor for a methods collection on <a href="https://app.jove.com/methods-collections/3161?">“Retinal Disease Analysis and Therapy”</a> in the Journal of Visualized Experiments (JoVE). JoVE is the leading peer-reviewed scientific methods video journal, aimed at increasing the visibility and reproducibility of research. To date very few journals publish video articles in the biomedical field, despite this type of article being of paramount importance for sharing techniques and improving replicability. Hence, I started a methods collection to offer a comprehensive overview of methodology in the field of vision sciences – more specifically to provide detailed techniques for the structural and functional analysis of both healthy and diseased retina, as well as experimental protocols for therapy design and testing.
