<b>Advisor of the iGEM teams</b> <br>
iGEM (international Genetically Engineered Machine) is a synthetic biology competition for students at Bachelor and Master level. As an advisor to the teams I am involved brainstorming with students, evaluating their scientific ideas, giving feedback, support for design of experiments, helping them critically analyze the results of the experiments and communicating the project at the final competition. <br>

<b>2024:</b> HUST-UEVE-UPSaclay team from Wuhan, China (<a href="https://2024.igem.wiki/hust-ueve-upsaclay/attributions">External Advisor</a>) <br>
I mentored the HUST-UEVE-UPSaclay team on their project ‘Aqua Guardian 2’ which focused on using synthetic biology to develop a dual-system for microplastic degradation (using E.Coli) and collection (using C.elegans). Our team won a gold medal at the iGEM competition held in Paris, France. <br>

<b>2023:</b> iGEM Paris-Saclay team from Evry, France (<a href="https://2023.igem.wiki/evry-paris-saclay/team">Team Advisor</a>) <br>
I mentored the Evry-Paris-Saclay team on their project ‘Optogenesis’ which focused on using directed evolution to generate new variants of microbial opsins that can be used for vision restoration. Our team won the best hardware award, nomination for the best software and the iGEM gold medal. These achievements received attention and coverage from Centre Supélec, Evry University, Genopole and CEA.
