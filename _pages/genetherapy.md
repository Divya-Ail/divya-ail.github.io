<h4><b>Gene therapy for neurodegenerative diseases</b></h4>

<p align="justify" style="font-size:0.75em">
Inherited Retinal Diseases (IRDs) are a group of genetic disorders that cause progressive vision loss due to mutations in genes essential for retinal function. These diseases can affect different retinal cell types, including photoreceptors, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and retinal ganglion cells. Gene therapy is a promising treatment approach for such diseases aiming to treat such diseases by delivering therapeutic genes to the affected neurons using delivery vectors. Gene therapy is the manipulation of gene expression by gene replacement, gene knock-down, gene editing, non-coding RNA modifications etc. to achieve a therapeutic effect. This involves the delivery of a transgene (the therapeutic gene) packaged inside a delivery vector such as viral vectors, nanoparticles, liposomes etc. The most commonly used vector for retinal gene therapy is Adeno-associated Virus (AAV). In 2017, the first AAV-based gene therapy (Luxturna by Spark therapeutics) was approved for a rare retinal degenerative disease called Leberâ€™s Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) caused by mutation in the RPE65 gene. The gene therapy consists of a correct version of RPE65 gene packaged in the AAV2 vector and delivered to the retina by subretinal injections. Since the success of Luxturna, many AAV-mediated therapies are being developed and several are in clinical trials. The new therapies in trial differ in the type of vector used (natural vs engineered), route of delivery (subretinal or intravitreal) and the therapy strategy (gene replacement, gene editing etc.) as shown below. </p>

However, to ensure safety and efficacy of these therapies there are certain challenges that need to be addressed.
